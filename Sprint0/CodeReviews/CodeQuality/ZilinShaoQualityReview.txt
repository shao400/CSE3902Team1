Controller/ItemsController.cs
Main Author: ChuWen Sun

The quality of this code is high. This class has three static variables, an object create 
from main class Game1, a dictionary with parameters Keys and ICommand named keymap, and 
a KeyboardState variable prev and state. Three variables are all made as private to avoid
useless overheads. And in the constructor, a instance of main class Game1 is passed in. 
What need to mention here is that, prev is initialized in the constructor, while state is
in Update() method. In update() method, he declared and initilized an array so that the keys
get pressed can be used. And a double if statement: state.IsKeyDown(key)
&& !prev.IsKeyDown(key) and keymap.ContainsKey(key) here to avoid overheads.
